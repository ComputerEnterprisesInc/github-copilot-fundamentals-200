# Creating a RockPaperScissors class with GitHub Copilot

1. See the lab-files directory and navigate to the `game.java` file, open the file

2. In your `game.java` file add a few comments to describe what your `RockPaperScissors` class should do as given below: 

```
// create a rock paper scissors game
// 1. ask user to input rock paper or scissors
// 2. have the computer select a random choice
// 3. compare the two choices and send out the results
// 4. ask the user if they want to play again
```

3. Create a new class named `RockPaperScissors`

```
public class RockPaperScissors{

}
```

4. Write out the step 1 comment (`1. ask a user to input rock paper or scissors`) into the class and press enter. GitHub Copilot should start suggesting code which you can decide to reject or accept 

**_Shortcut Tip:_** If GitHub Copilot has not started suggesting code, you can trigger it by pressing: 

- Option + \ for mac
- Alt + \ for windows
- Alt + \ for linux

5. Add in the step 2 comment (`2. have the computer select a random choice`) and press enter. More code suggestions should appear. Accept the suggestions by pressing tab

6. Add in the step 3 comment (`3. compare the two choices and send out the results`) and press **ctrl + enter** to look through multiple suggestions, accept which works best for your program

7. Add in the step 4 comment (`4. ask the user if they want to play again`) and press enter. Accept the code suggestion by pressing tab
