# Refactor and Improve Code with GitHub Copilot Chat

1. Ensure that both `game.java` and `gameComparison.java` are open in your VS Code window

2. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat window and use the following prompt:

```
How can I improve the code for the rock, paper scissors game in game.java?
Provide a refactored version of the file.
```

3. Create a new file with the newly suggested code, save the file into the `lab-files` directory and name it `gameRefactored.java`

4. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat window once again, and use the following prompt:

```
Convert the code in game.java into a new Python file. This file should have multiple functions and a main method for running the code. The functions should not have docstrings.

Think step-by-step.
```

_How does thinking "step-by-step" improve the output from GitHub Copilot?_

5. Create a new file with the newly suggested code, save the file into the `lab-files` directory and name it `game-python.py`
