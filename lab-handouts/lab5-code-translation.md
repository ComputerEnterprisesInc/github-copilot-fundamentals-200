# Code Translation with GitHub Copilot

One of the ways that GitHub Copilot Chat can act as our research assistant is through using its incredible translation features. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to translate files into other languages, or alternatively explain the similarities/differences between programming languages

## Task 1

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat and use it to research the differences between C# and Python with the prompt: 

```
Provide 5 bullet points for the similarities and differences between C# and Python
```

2. Visualize the differences between the languages by prompting GitHub Copilot Chat to create `hello_world` functions for each:

```
Create hello_world() functions in C# and Python. Detail the differences between each.
```

3. Review the information provided by GitHub Copilot, noting a few distinct differences between C# and Python: 
  - Syntax
  - Typing
  - Memory Management
  - Use Cases

## Task 2

1. Open `SIR.cs` and translate it into the Python programming language:

2. Select all of the code in `SIR.cs` and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to translate the selected code into Python

```
Translate the selected code into Python
```

3. Add the newly translated code into a new file named `SIR.py`

4. Reprompt GitHub Copilot chat to explain the differences between the SIR models:

```
What are the differences between the SIR models in C# and Python?
```

5. With the code in `SIR.cs` and `SIR.py` selected, prompt GitHub Copilot Chat once more to translate the model into the language of your choosing i.e.:

```
Translate the selected code into the Go programming language
```
  
6. Insert the code into a new, corresponding file

## Task 3

1. Save all of your changes, ensuring your files are in the `lab-files` directory 

2. 7. Move onto the [next lab task](lab-handouts/lab6-bug-fixes.md)
